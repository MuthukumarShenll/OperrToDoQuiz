Create simple todo application where you can create/edit/delete/list tasks

App should be in  Objective-C. You need to use any local database and it needs to sync with Firebase realtime database. Now suppose if I add new task into Firebase through online console window. It should appear into the app and once the app disconnected from the internet, user can also see previous tasks.

Write all possible test cases

Code quality and documentation will be my first and high priority

App shouldn’t generate any exception no matter wrong user input or by system memory management
